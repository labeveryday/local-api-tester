# Roadmap on potential improvements

1. Short-term improvements (1-2 months):

   a. Add support for more HTTP methods (PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD)
   b. Implement request history/logging
   c. Add ability to save and load requests
   d. Implement pretty-printing for JSON responses
   e. Add basic error handling and display error messages to users
   f. Implement basic authentication options (Basic Auth, API Key)

2. Medium-term goals (3-6 months):

   a. Add syntax highlighting for request/response bodies
   b. Implement request collections/folders for organization
   c. Add environment variables for reusable values across requests
   d. Implement request chaining (use response data in subsequent requests)
   e. Add support for file uploads
   f. Implement basic testing features (response validation, assertions)
   g. Add export/import functionality for requests and collections

3. Long-term vision (6+ months):

   a. Implement a more robust authentication system (OAuth 2.0, JWT)
   b. Add support for WebSocket connections
   c. Implement request mocking and response simulation
   d. Add collaboration features (shared collections, team workspaces)
   e. Develop a plugin system for extending functionality
   f. Implement performance testing features (load testing, benchmarking)
   g. Add API documentation generation based on requests and responses
   h. Develop a desktop application version using Electron or similar framework

4. Continuous improvements:

   a. Enhance UI/UX based on user feedback
   b. Optimize performance and reduce load times
   c. Improve error handling and provide more informative error messages
   d. Enhance security features and implement best practices
   e. Keep dependencies up-to-date
   f. Write and maintain comprehensive documentation
   g. Implement automated testing for the application itself

5. Advanced features (consider based on user needs and resources):

   a. Implement real-time collaboration features
   b. Add support for GraphQL APIs
   c. Develop a command-line interface (CLI) version
   d. Implement API monitoring and alerting features
   e. Add support for generating client code based on API requests
   f. Implement machine learning features for API testing and optimization
